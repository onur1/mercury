# mailroom

Mailroom is a lightweight system for managing user lifecycle emails, such as account activations and password recovery.

## Features

- **Event-Driven**: Processes database changes in real time without polling or relying on external queues.
- **Batch Processing**: Collects emails into batches based on configurable size and time thresholds.
- **Security**: Ensures secure authentication with HMAC-signed secrets, reducing reliance on database lookups.
- **Resilient**: Automatically reconnects to the database and resumes processing after transient connection failures.

## Components

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is configured to manage the **state-token relationship** and operate as a **single-consumer work queue**.

- **Triggers**: Automatically generating actions (like inserting tokens) or sending notifications.
- **Cursors (`jobs`)**: Tracking progress of processed actions.

#### How Notifications Work?

- Tokens are inserted into the `tokens` table with details like action type, unique secret, code.
- A trigger sends a `NOTIFY` event for each new token.
- The `listener` listens to this channel and processes token rows.

### Listener

The `listener` captures events from a notification channel, **counts** them, and **queries the database** when either a given row limit (based on the number of received notifications) is reached or a timeout elapses. It writes the results as **line-delimited** batches of data to stdout. Each line in the output contains up to the configured limit of rows, formatted as comma-separated values in the following order:

```
action,email,username,secret,code
```

This schema is repeated for each row in the batch, all included in a single line.

- **`action`**: Numeric representation of the email action type (e.g., `1` for activation, `2` for password recovery).
- **`email`**: Recipient's email address.
- **`username`**: Recipient's login name.
- **`secret`**: A base64 URL-encoded string containing the signed token.
- **`code`**: Optional numeric code (e.g., for password recovery).

##### Example

Here, the first line contains a batch of three actions, including both password recovery and account activation actions. The second line contains a single action for account activation.

```

### Sender

The `sender` processes these lines, **groups destinations** by action type, and **delivers templated bulk emails** via AWS SES. Simply pipe two processes together, and watch the emails take flight:

```sh
./listener | ./sender
```

## Environment Variables

Both components are fully configured using environment variables. Hereâ€™s the list, their purposes, and default values:

### listener

| Name                            | Default Value          | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAILROOM_DATABASE_URL`         | _None (required)_      | PostgreSQL connection string.                                              |
| `MAILROOM_SECRET_KEY`           | _None (required)_      | 64-character hexadecimal string used as the secret key for HMAC.           |
| `MAILROOM_CHANNEL_NAME`         | `token_insert`         | Name of the PostgreSQL NOTIFY channel to listen for notifications.         |
| `MAILROOM_QUEUE_NAME`           | `user_action_queue`    | Name of the PostgreSQL queue or table for storing user actions.            |
| `MAILROOM_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL` | `270000` (4.5 minutes) | Interval in milliseconds for health checks on the database connection.     |
| `MAILROOM_BATCH_TIMEOUT`        | `5000` (5 seconds)     | Timeout in milliseconds to wait for accumulating a batch of notifications. |
| `MAILROOM_BATCH_LIMIT`          | `10`                   | Maximum number of items to process in a single batch.                      |

### sender

| Name                       | Default Value       | Description                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MAILROOM_DEBUG`           | `false`             | Enables debug mode, logging requests and responses to stdout without sending emails. |
| `MAILROOM_SES_CONFIG_SET`  | `default`           | Name of the SES configuration set to use for sending emails.                         |
| `MAILROOM_SES_SOURCE`      | `noreply@localhost` | Email address used as the sender.                                                    |
| `MAILROOM_SES_OUTPUT_PATH` | `./output`          | Directory path for saving HTTP responses from SES.                                   |

## Database Migrations

The `migrations` folder contains SQL scripts for initializing the database schema. These scripts are managed using the [`go-migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) tool.

The initial migration includes:

- Creating tables (`accounts`, `tokens`, `jobs`).
- Defining custom types (e.g., `account_status`, `token_action`, `job_type`).
- Adding triggers for token insertion, account status changes, and token consumption.
- Setting up indexes for improved query performance.

To run the migrations:

```bash
go install -tags 'postgres' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest

migrate -database "postgres://localhost:5432/example?sslmode=disable" -path migrations up
```

#### Quick Testing

You can quickly populate the database for testing purposes.

```bash
printf "%.0sINSERT INTO accounts (email, login) VALUES ('user' || md5(random()::text) || '@example.com', 'user' || substr(md5(random()::text), 1, 20));select pg_sleep(0.3);\n" {1..42} | psql "postgres://localhost:5432/example"
```

## Building

### listener

The `src` folder contains the `listener` code written in C. To compile it, ensure you have `openssl@3` and `libpq@5` installed on your system, then use the provided Makefile.

- **Makefile Targets**
  - `release`: Compiles an optimized binary for production use. Default target.
  - `debug`: Compiles a binary with debug symbols for development.
  - `clean`: Removes build artifacts.

### sender

The `sender` is written in Rust and uses the `cargo` build system. Its key dependency is the `aws-sdk-ses` crate, which handles interactions with AWS SES.

**Example:** Build a debug release and run:

```bash
make clean && make debug && \
  (cd sender && cargo build) && \
  MAILROOM_DATABASE_URL="dbname=aegis" \
  MAILROOM_SECRET_KEY='deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef' \
    ./listener | \
    MAILROOM_DEBUG=true ./sender/target/debug/sender
```

## Docker

Build image:

```bash
docker build -t mailroom:dev .
```

Run container:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -e DATABASE_URL="dbname=example host=host.docker.internal port=5432 user=postgres" \
  -e SECRET_KEY='deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef' \
  --rm \
  --name mailroom \
  --memory=6m \
  mailroom:dev
```
